# Network-Scanner
Network Scanner Using Python the network scanner will send the ARP request indicating who has some specific IP address, let's say "192.168.1.1", the owner of that IP address ( the target ) will automatically respond saying that he is "192.168.1.1", with that response, the MAC address will also be included in the packet
